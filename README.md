# Welcome to [backend practice 1](https://github.com/gerveloper/backend-practice-1 "backend practice 1")!


In this little project I worked in a **Node.Js** runtime environment to develop a small API to perform CRUD operation in a **MongoDB** database. Also, there is a very basic user registration form that saves their information to the data base and sends them an email to confirm the process via link. 
In addition to this, I took the liberty to practice a little bit with the static and instance methods in the User.js schema.

#### What I worked with:

- **Node.js** with **Express** framework to create the routes;
- **MongoDB** and **MongoDB Compass** as a GUI to quickly access the collections (when it wasnÂ´t a simple check, I worked with **mongosh**);
- **Mongoose** to structure the data;
- **Nodemailer** to send the emails and **Ethereal** as a fake SMTP service and
- **Postman** to check all the API endpoints.

That's all, folks! Thank you so much for reading! ;)
